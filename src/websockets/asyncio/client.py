    Connect to the WebSocket server at ``uri``.

        from websockets.asyncio.client import connect

        async with connect(...) as websocket:

    The connection is closed automatically when exiting the context.

            except websockets.ConnectionClosed:

    If the connection fails with a transient error, it is retried with
    exponential backoff. If it fails with a fatal error, the exception is
    raised, breaking out of the loop.

    The connection is closed automatically after each iteration of the loop.

    Args:
        uri: URI of the WebSocket server.
        origin: Value of the ``Origin`` header, for servers that require it.
        extensions: List of supported extensions, in order in which they
            should be negotiated and run.
        subprotocols: List of supported subprotocols, in order of decreasing
            preference.
        additional_headers (HeadersLike | None): Arbitrary HTTP headers to add
            to the handshake request.
        user_agent_header: Value of  the ``User-Agent`` request header.
            It defaults to ``"Python/x.y.z websockets/X.Y"``.
            Setting it to :obj:`None` removes the header.
        compression: The "permessage-deflate" extension is enabled by default.
            Set ``compression`` to :obj:`None` to disable it. See the
            :doc:`compression guide <../../topics/compression>` for details.
        process_exception: When reconnecting automatically, tell whether an
            error is transient or fatal. The default behavior is defined by
            :func:`process_exception`. Refer to its documentation for details.
        open_timeout: Timeout for opening the connection in seconds.
            :obj:`None` disables the timeout.
        ping_interval: Interval between keepalive pings in seconds.
            :obj:`None` disables keepalive.
        ping_timeout: Timeout for keepalive pings in seconds.
            :obj:`None` disables timeouts.
        close_timeout: Timeout for closing the connection in seconds.
            :obj:`None` disables the timeout.
        max_size: Maximum size of incoming messages in bytes.
            :obj:`None` disables the limit.
        max_queue: High-water mark of the buffer where frames are received.
            It defaults to 16 frames. The low-water mark defaults to ``max_queue
            // 4``. You may pass a ``(high, low)`` tuple to set the high-water
            and low-water marks.
        write_limit: High-water mark of write buffer in bytes. It is passed to
            :meth:`~asyncio.WriteTransport.set_write_buffer_limits`. It defaults
            to 32Â KiB. You may pass a ``(high, low)`` tuple to set the
            high-water and low-water marks.
        logger: Logger for this client.
            It defaults to ``logging.getLogger("websockets.client")``.
            See the :doc:`logging guide <../../topics/logging>` for details.
        create_connection: Factory for the :class:`ClientConnection` managing
            the connection. Set it to a wrapper or a subclass to customize
            connection handling.

    Any other keyword arguments are passed to the event loop's
    :meth:`~asyncio.loop.create_connection` method.

    For example:

    * You can set ``ssl`` to a :class:`~ssl.SSLContext` to enforce TLS settings.
      When connecting to a ``wss://`` URI, if ``ssl`` isn't provided, a TLS
      context is created with :func:`~ssl.create_default_context`.

    * You can set ``server_hostname`` to override the host name from ``uri`` in
      the TLS handshake.

    * You can set ``host`` and ``port`` to connect to a different host and port
      from those found in ``uri``. This only changes the destination of the TCP
      connection. The host name from ``uri`` is still used in the TLS handshake
      for secure connections and in the ``Host`` header.

    * You can set ``sock`` to provide a preexisting TCP socket. You may call
      :func:`socket.create_connection` (not to be confused with the event loop's
      :meth:`~asyncio.loop.create_connection` method) to create a suitable
      client socket and customize it.

    Raises:
        InvalidURI: If ``uri`` isn't a valid WebSocket URI.
        OSError: If the TCP connection fails.
        InvalidHandshake: If the opening handshake fails.
        TimeoutError: If the opening handshake times out.
